/**
    A very common design involves custom buttons with background images that
    match the button vertically, but need to be stretched horizontally to
    match the button width. The provided image is just wide enough to define the
    two end caps, and so must be split down the middle and stretched.
    
    This method replaces the image specified in the button (usually in IB) with
    a horizontally stretched version of the image, capped at one-half the width
    of the image. For each OS-defined button state (normal, highighted, selected,
    disabled) with an image, a new image is created to replace it.
